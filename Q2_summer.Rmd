# Background Information

***In this question, you are not allowed to use*** ***any pre-implemented modules for performing discriminant analysis, but you’ll have to implement this yourself.***

Colors can be coded via their RGB (red, green, blue) value in the form `(r,g,b)`, where `r`, `g`, and `b` are integers between 00 and 255. For example, `(255,0,0)` is pure red, and `(128,200,128)` is a shade of green.

In this exercise we will map `(r,g,b)` values to their color names. For example, we want `(255,0,0)` to be classified as red.

In order to make things a bit easier, we focus on the part of color space where `g=0`, i.e. there is no green component. This means the feature space is all combinations `(r,0,b)`, where `r` and `b` are between 0 and 255. For orientation, here is a visualisation of some of these colors, with each circle having the color of its `r`-`b`-coordinate.

```{r}
rs <- seq(0,256,5) 
bs <- seq(0,256,5)
df_plot_colors <- data.frame(rs = rs, bs=bs) %>% tidyr::expand(rs, bs)
ggplot(data=df_plot_colors) + 
  geom_point(aes(x=rs, y=bs, color=rgb(rs/256,0,bs/256)), size=1)+
  # R's rgb code works with numbers between 0 and 1 instead of between 0 and 255.
  scale_color_identity() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Our goal is to create a classification algorithm that takes an `r` value, and a `b` value, and outputs the name of the color this corresponds to.

Thankfully, we have a dataset where some of these labels have been entered. This is visualised below

```{r}
# Visualize training data in (r, b) space
df_colors <- read.csv("./data/unzipped/colors_train.csv")
df_colors_augmented <- df_colors %>% mutate(rgb = rgb(r/256,0,b/256))

ggplot(data=df_colors_augmented, aes( r, b, label = color)) +
  geom_point(aes(x=r, y=b, color=rgb), size=3) +
  geom_text(data = df_colors, check_overlap = TRUE) +
  scale_color_identity() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

*Figure 1: Each point represents a color sample, labeled by its class name. Colors are plotted according to their RGB values.*

# Solution

## How many classes are there in the dataset?

```{r}
classes <- df_colors_augmented %>% pull("color") %>% unique 
class_num <- classes %>% length
class_num
```

Therefore, there are 5 classes, which correspond to the following colors:

```{r}
classes
```

We also define a vector for above 5 colors for reusing purpose.

```{r}
color_names=c("purple","pink","red","brown","blue")
```

## Fit a QDA algorithm to this classification problem and visualise the decision boundaries in a suitable way.

The general discriminant score function takes the following form:

$$ \delta_k(\underline x) = -\frac{(\underline x - \underline m_k)^\top C_k^{-1} (\underline x - \underline m_k)}{2} - \frac{\log \mathrm{det}(C_k)}{2} + \log \pi_k$$

Now we are using 2 features, `red:=df_colors_augmented$r` and `blue:=df_colors_augmented$b`, to predict the class: `color:= df_colors_augmented$color`.

For each class $X = \underline{x}|class=k$, we need to know its *mean vector(* $m_k$ *)*, *covariance matrix(* $C_{k}$ *)* and the prior probability( $\pi_k$*)* . Here $\underline{x}$ represents a vector corresponding to class $k$.

### Dataset Split

Use `split_data` function to split the dataset into a training set and a test set with the ratio of 8:2.

```{r}
# split_data is the same function in Q1. Here we just reuse it.
df_colors <- split_data(data = df_colors_augmented,train_ratio = 0.8)
```

Later we can train our model on `df_colors$train` and test our model on `df_colors$test`.

### Build Up Discriminant Score Function

We have 5 classes as below:

```{r}
unique(df_colors$train$color)
```

To improve the efficiency of calculation process, we define a function `stat_cal` to solve $m_k, C_k, \pi_k$.

```{r}
# Function: Calculate class statistics: mean, covariance, prior
# Arguments:
#   category_name: Category name (string)
#   df: DataFrame (pandas DataFrame)
# Returns:
#   A list containing the number of rows, column means, and covariance matrix for the category

stat_cal <- function(category_name, df) {
  # Filter the DataFrame for the specified category
  df_filtered <- df %>% filter(color == category_name)

  # Calculate the number of rows in the category
  n <- nrow(df_filtered)

  # Calculate the portion of rows in the category
  pi <- n/nrow(df)
  
  # Calculate the column means for 'r' and 'b'
  m <- df_filtered %>% select(r, b) %>% colMeans
  
  # Calculate the covariance matrix for 'r' and 'b'
  Sigma <- df_filtered %>% select(r, b) %>% cov
  
  return(list(pi = pi, m = m, Sigma = Sigma))
}

```

For all 5 classes, we applied a `sapply` function to above calculation process to obtain the `stat_values` matrix, which combines $n, \pi, m, \sigma$ for each class.

```{r}
color_stat_values <- sapply(color_names, function(color) {
  stat_cal(category_name = color, df = df_colors$train)
})

color_stat_values
# we can call the value of purple by follow code
# color_stat_values["pi","purple"]
```

N.B. We can verify the statistic values above by summing the `pi` values; the sum should equal 1. `pi` represents the prior probability, indicated by each class's frequency over all events.

```{r}
sum(unlist(color_stat_values["pi",]))
```

The sum of prior probabilities is 1, confirming correct class proportions.

Then we defined a function `delta` to calculate the delta value, given class input ( $X=x$ ) and its mean *vector*( $m_k$ ), prior probability( $\pi_k$ ) and *covariance* matrix( $C_k$ ).

```{r}
# Function: Compute discriminant score for each row (sample) in X
# Args:
#   X: A numeric vector representing an observation.
#   mean: The mean vector of the class.
#   Sigma: The covariance matrix of the class.
#   pi: The prior probability of the class.
#
# Returns:
#   The discriminant function value for the sample belonging to the class.

delta <- function(X, mean, Sigma, pi){
  X_minus_mean <- X - mean 
  Sigma_inv <- solve(Sigma)
  dv <- -t(X_minus_mean) %*% Sigma_inv %*% X_minus_mean / 2 - log(det(Sigma))/2 + log(pi)
  return(dv)
}
```

Now, we can apply function `delta` to calculate classes' delta values of a given class.

```{r}
X_purple <- df_colors$train %>% filter(color == "purple") %>% select(r, b)
X_purple_stat <- stat_cal(category_name = "purple",df = df_colors$train)
delta_purple <- apply(X_purple, 1, function(row) {
  delta(X = as.numeric(row),
        mean = X_purple_stat$m,
        Sigma = X_purple_stat$Sigma,
        pi = X_purple_stat$pi) # each row returns to a dv value, so delta_purple is a col
})

```

Similarly, we applied a loop function to above delta calculation process.

```{r}
# Create an empty list to store the results
delta_values <- list()

# Loop through each color category
for (cname in color_names) {
  # 1. Extract data for the specific color
  X_color <- df_colors$train %>% 
    filter(color == !!cname) %>%  
    select(r, b)
  
  # 2. Calculate statistics
  X_color_stat <- stat_cal(category_name = cname, df = df_colors$train)
  
  # 3. Calculate discriminant values for each sample in this class
  delta_color <- apply(X_color, MARGIN = 1, function(row) {
    delta(X = as.numeric(row),
          mean = X_color_stat$m,
          Sigma = X_color_stat$Sigma,
          pi = X_color_stat$pi)
  })
  
  # 4. Store the results in the list
  delta_values[[cname]] <- list(
    X = X_color,
    stat = X_color_stat,
    delta = delta_color
  )
}

```

### Visualise the Decision Boundaries

Now we have stored all classes' delta values in the list `delta_values` and we can call them by using `delta_values[["cname"]]$delta`. Then, we use these 5 delta values to visualise the decision boundary.

```{r}
# 1. Generate a 2D grid of (r, b) values to evaluate decision boundaries
plot_grid <- expand.grid(
  r = seq(min(df_colors$test$r), max(df_colors$test$r), length.out = 100),
  b = seq(min(df_colors$test$b), max(df_colors$test$b), length.out = 100)
)

# 2. Predict the color class for each grid point using QDA
plot_grid <- plot_grid %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(
    pred_by_hand = {
    # For each point (r, b), compute the discriminant score for each class
    deltas <- sapply(color_names, function(color) {
      delta(
        X = c(r, b),
        mean = delta_values[[color]]$stat$m,
        Sigma = delta_values[[color]]$stat$Sigma,
        pi = delta_values[[color]]$stat$pi
      )
    })
    # Assign the class with the highest discriminant score
    color_names[which.max(deltas)]
  }) %>%
  ungroup()
```

*Figure 2: The boundaries between different colors represent decision boundaries, labeled by its class name.*

```{r}
# Plot the test set with predicted classes and decision boundary
ggplot() +
  # separate by background color (predicted class regions)
  geom_tile(data = plot_grid,
            aes(x = r, y = b, fill = pred_by_hand), # Map predicted class to fill
            alpha = 0.3) + # Set transparency to see points below
  # actual classification (test points)
  geom_point(data = df_colors$test,
             aes(x = r, y = b, shape = color), # Map actual class to shape
             size = 2, 
             alpha = 0.9) +
  # Add labels and theme settings
  labs(title = "QDA Predictions on Test Set with Decision Boundary",
       x = "r",
       y = "b",
       fill = "Predicted Color", # Fill legend title
       shape = "Actual Color") + # Shape legend title
  theme_minimal()


```

### Testing Point (200,0,200)

Now, we have our decision boundaries as shown in Figure 2, and the parameters are stored in `delta_values`. If we receive an input point, which has features `r` and `b`, we can make our prediction on its color. Furthermore, we defined a function to smooth this process as below.

```{r}
test_point <- c(200, 200)

# test_deltas returns a vector which stores five `dv` values, since color_names' length is 5.
test_deltas <- sapply(color_names, function(color) {
  delta(
    X = test_point,
    mean = delta_values[[color]]$stat$m,
    Sigma = delta_values[[color]]$stat$Sigma,
    pi = delta_values[[color]]$stat$pi
  ) # delta returns a dv value
})

predicted_200qda <- color_names[which.max(test_deltas)]
predicted_200qda

```

For the point (200, 0, 200), we made our prediction that it belongs to the class "purple."

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# 1. Create a data frame for the test point
test_point_df <- data.frame(
  r = 200,
  b = 200,
  label = "point(200,200)"
)

ggplot(plot_grid, aes(x = r, y = b)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = pred_by_hand)) +  
  geom_point(data = test_point_df, aes(x = r, y = b), 
             shape = 8, size = 4, color = "white", stroke = 1.5) +  
  geom_text(data = test_point_df, aes(x = r, y = b, label = label),
            vjust = -1.2, color = "white", size = 4) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "QDA Decision Boundaries with Test Point (200,0,200)",
       fill = "Predicted Color")


```

*Figure 3:* QDA Decision Boundaries with Test Point (200,0,200)

### Testing On Test Data Set

```{r}
# Define a function to predict for a single sample point
predict_qda_manual <- function(point) {
deltas <- sapply(color_names, function(color) {
 delta(
   X = point,
   mean = delta_values[[color]]$stat$m,
   Sigma = delta_values[[color]]$stat$Sigma,
   pi = delta_values[[color]]$stat$pi
 )
})
# Return the class corresponding to the maximum delta
return(color_names[which.max(deltas)])
}

# Predict for each row in the test set
test_data <- df_colors$test %>% select(r,b)

# QDA prediction result stores in predicted_labels_QDA
predicted_labels_QDA <- apply(test_data, 1, 
                              function(row) {
                                point <- c(row['r'], row['b'])
                                predict_qda_manual(point)
                                }
                              )
```

Now, we have our prediction result `predicted_labels_QDA` responding to `df_colors$test`.

## kNN-Classification

While preparing to train our custom kNN algorithm, we observed that R offers a direct training method (as shown below), which suggested an optimal $k$ of 1. This result appears unusual. Further testing of the kNN method with different random seeds revealed that the optimal \$k\$ value varied based on how the training data set was partitioned.

```{r}
# Train kNN model with trainControl
control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10) # K-Fold Cross-Validation
knn_model <- train(color~ r + b,
data = df_colors$train,
method = "knn",
trControl = control,
tuneGrid = data.frame(k = 1:20))
print(knn_model)
```

### Algorithm Hypothsis

Compared to the QDA method, kNN uses **Euclidean distance** to measure the similarity between sample points and test points. For a given input feature point $X=x$, we identify $x$'s $k$ nearest neighbors in the training set. The class label for the test point $x$ is determined by a majority vote among these $k$ neighbors. Specifically, we calculate the distances from $x$ to each of its $k$ neighbors and assign $x$ the label that appears most frequently among them.

#### Euclidean Distance

```{r}
# Calculate Euclidean distance
euclidean_distance <- function(x1, x2) {
  sqrt(sum((x1 - x2) ^ 2))
}
```

#### Find Neighbors

1.  **Function Purpose**: The function `find_neighbors` is designed to find the $k$ nearest neighbors for a given test sample from the training data.

2.  **Distance Calculation**: The `apply` function is used to iterate over each row in the specified columns ("r" and "b") of the `train_data`, calculating the Euclidean distance between each training sample and the `test_sample`.

3.  **Return Neighbors**: The `order` function is used to sort the distances and return the indices of the $k$ smallest distances, which correspond to the $k$ nearest neighbors.

```{r}
# Find k nest neighbours among train data set
find_neighbors <- function(train_data, test_sample, k) {
  distances <- apply(train_data[, c("r", "b")], 1, function(train_sample) {
    euclidean_distance(train_sample, test_sample)
  })
  # Return the index of the minimum distance 
  order(distances)[1:k]
}
```

#### Voting Out Highest Frequency Label

The `get_majority_vote` function determines the most common label among the nearest neighbors.

```{r}
# get_majority_vote
#
# Purpose:
# Determines the most common label among the nearest neighbors.
#
# Parameters:
# - neighbors: A vector of indices representing the nearest neighbors.
# - train_labels: A vector containing the labels of the training data.
#
# Returns:
# - The label that appears most frequently among the neighbors.
get_majority_vote <- function(neighbors, train_labels) {
  neighbor_labels <- train_labels[neighbors]
  # Return the most frequent label
  names(sort(table(neighbor_labels), decreasing = TRUE))[1]
}


```

```{r}
# knn_classify
#
# Purpose:
# Classifies test data using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
#
# Parameters:
# - train_data: A data frame containing the training samples with features.
# - train_labels: A vector containing the labels for the training data.
# - test_data: A data frame containing the test samples to classify.
# - k: The number of nearest neighbors to consider for classification.
#
# Returns:
# - A vector of predicted labels for the test data.
knn_classify <- function(train_data, train_labels, test_data, k) {
  predictions <- sapply(1:nrow(test_data), function(i) {
    test_sample <- test_data[i, c("r", "b")]
    neighbors <- find_neighbors(train_data, test_sample, k)
    get_majority_vote(neighbors, train_labels)
  })
  return(predictions)
}

```

#### KNN Classification Model Training

```{r}
# Classify test data using k-Nearest Neighbors
#
# Assigns labels to test samples based on the training data.
#
# Inputs:
# - df_colors$train: Training data with features ("r", "b") and labels.
# - train_labels: Vector of labels for the training data.
# - test_data: Data frame of test samples with features ("r", "b").
# - k: Number of neighbors to consider.
#
# Output:
# - knn_predictions: Predicted labels for the test data.
knn_predictions <- knn_classify(df_colors$train, train_labels = df_colors$train$color, df_colors$test, k=10)

```

#### Test Point (200,0,200)

```{r}
# Define the test point
test_point <- data.frame(r = 200, b = 200)

# Find the indices of the nearest neighbors
neighbors_indices <- find_neighbors(train_data = df_colors$train, test_sample = test_point, k=10)

# Retrieve the labels of the neighbors
neighbor_labels <- df_colors$train$color[neighbors_indices]

# Perform majority voting to determine the predicted label
predicted_knn200 <- get_majority_vote(neighbors_indices, df_colors$train$color)

# Output the prediction result
print(paste("The predicted label for point (200,0,200) is:", predicted_knn200))


```

It is relatively straightforward to understand why kNN predicts the point as pink, unlike QDA which predicts it as purple. As shown in Figure 3, titled "QDA Decision Boundaries with Test Point (200, 0, 200)," the point (200, 200) is located very close to the decision boundary between the purple and pink regions.

The kNN method determines the classification based on the majority class among its k (here we set k=10 in our by-hand kNN algorithm ) nearest neighbors, as illustrated by the bright area in the figure below. We can observe that the number of pink neighbors is clearly higher than the number of purple neighbors. This is why kNN classifies the point (200, 200) as pink, whereas QDA classifies it as purple.

  )
)

  ggplot(df, aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted, fill = Freq)) +
    geom_tile(color = "white") +
    scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "steelblue") +
    geom_text(aes(label = Freq), color = "black", size = 4) +

```

```{r , echo=FALSE}
# QDA Confusion Matrix Heatmap
plot_confusion_heatmap(df_QDA, "QDA Confusion Matrix Heatmap")
```

In conclusion, our QDA model performs slightly better than the kNN model when $k=10$.
