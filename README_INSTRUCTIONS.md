# 📘 Assignment Instructions Summary – STAT462A2

This document complements the main `README.md` by summarising the official STAT462 Assignment 2 instructions and assessment expectations. It serves as a persistent reference for David Ewing (82171165) and Xia Yu (62380486).

## ✅ Project Context

This assignment uses **R** to analyse a life expectancy dataset across 97 countries. You are expected to:

- Fit and compare **at least three models**.
- Include **at least one Generalised Linear Model (GLM)**.
- Present results in a concise A4 report using **British English** conventions.

---

## 🧪 Required Modelling Tasks

- Use a mix of:
  - Linear and polynomial terms
  - Variable transformations
  - Interaction terms
  - Stepwise selection (if used, explain)
  - Regularisation (optional; justify clearly)

- Evaluate models using:
  - **Deviance**, **AIC**, **BIC**
  - **Residual analysis**, **ROC curves**
  - **Misclassification rate**, **sensitivity**, **specificity**

---

## 🛠 Tools and Conventions

- Use only permitted R packages: `glm`, `dplyr`, `ggplot2`
- Avoid `stepAIC()` and `regsubsets()` unless explicitly approved
- All code and figures must be:
  - Reproducible with **random seed `82171165`**
  - Commented using **British English**
